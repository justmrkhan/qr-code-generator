## 🌐 APIs

I used the QRC Generator API by [QOQR](https://goqr.me/api/).

## ⏳ The Process

1. I started by creating the website design on Figma (I'm a UIUX designer).
2. I finished the design and began building the website from scratch using HTML and CSS.
3. Once I finalised the front end of the website, I started playing around with JavaScript and incorporated the API using basic JS knowledge. At this point, I connected the API successfully.
4. After that, I created a GitHub Repository for the website and connected Netlify to the repo.
5. Lastly, I hosted the website on my subdomain (for easier access) and netlify.
